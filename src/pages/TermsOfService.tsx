      <p>The Program allows users to receive SMS/MMS messages by affirmatively opting in, such as through online or application-based enrollment forms. By participating, you agree to receive autodialed or prerecorded marketing messages at the phone number you provide. Consent to receive such messages is not required to make any purchase from us. Message and data rates may apply.</p>
      <h2>3. User Opt Out</h2>
